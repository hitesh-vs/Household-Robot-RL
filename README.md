# High to Low Level Task Planning and Execution using RL 

This project presents a framework for mobile manipulators using Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) and Reward Shaping to tackle complex tasks efficiently. Intrinsic Curiosity fosters self-driven exploration, while Unity ML Agents enable a proof-of-concept for navigation and object manipulation in unknown environments. Future work aims to integrate large language models (LLMs) for task decomposition and enhanced automation.

See [Report.pdf]([https://www.example.com/](https://github.com/hitesh-vs/Household-Robot-RL/blob/main/Report.pdf)) for in depth explaination of the project and its implementation details. 

The complete implementation of the project and the results we obtained are depicted in this presentation as well : [Link](https://rltaskplanner.my.canva.site/plan)
